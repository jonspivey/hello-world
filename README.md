Know-It-All Dad

I'm a (not so) self-proclaimed know-it-all. I've spent all of my life learning and trying new things, and the biggest thing that I've learned is that I can never learn too much. That is the basis behind this website. I want to learn everything I can so that I can teach everything that I've learned! I've also learned that classroom settings don't work so well for me. I work best in hands-on, creative, workshop situations.
